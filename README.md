You acknowledge that you have the priviledge to use the bot freely on any Discord Server (Server) you share with it, that you can invite it to any Server that you have "Manage Server" rights for and that this priviledge might get revoked for you, if you're subject of breaking the terms and/or policy of this bot, or the [Terms of service](https://discord.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and/or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) of [Discord Inc](https://discord.com/).

###  • Intended Age:

The bot may not be used by individuals under the minimal age described in Discord's Terms of Service.
Features, such as commands which are marked as "NSFW" (Not safe for work) may not be used by individuals under the age of maturity in their country. Doing so will be seen as a violation of these terms and will result in a removal of the bot from any servers you own.

###  • Affiliation:

The Bot is not affiliated with, supported or made by Discord Inc.
Any direct connection to Discord or any of its Trademark objects is purely coincidental. We do not claim to have the copyright ownership of any of Discord's assets, trademarks or other intellectual property.

### • Liability:
The owner of the bot may not be made liable for individuals breaking these Terms at any given time.
He has faith in the end users being truthfull about their information and not missusing this bot or The Services of Discord Inc in a malicious way.

We reserve the right to update these terms at our own discretion, giving you a 1-Week (7 days) period to opt out of these terms if you're not agreeing with the new changes.

## Privacy Policy

### Stored Information

when a user registers:
```
time_of_registration
user_id
sexuality
pronouns

```
when a server sets up a network:
```
network_id
channel_id
webhook_url
```
when a user uses any restrain commands:
```
server_id
user_id
type_of_restraint
```
for the bot's funcationality and to refer a user when commands are used the user's id maybe stored temporarily in the cache or in the database depending on the command's usages

### Updating Data:
The data may be updated when using specific commands.
Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarely stored Information
The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data
#### Automatic removal
Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.

#### Manual removal
Manual removal of the data can be requested through the support server by DMing any developer online.
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.

    The automatic removal of data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.
    Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.

    In such events can you request manual removal through the support server under the above mentioned conditions.
